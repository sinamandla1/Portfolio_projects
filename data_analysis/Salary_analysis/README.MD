The dataset used consists of a comprehensive collection of salary and demographic information with additional details on years of experience.
It looks as Race, Salary, Job Title, Age, Country, Gender, Education level, Years of Experience and a unique id for each row. We look at the set
to see relations between each column to make informed decisions and then visualize it using Tableau.
