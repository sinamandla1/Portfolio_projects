 I built a model that more accurately predicts the unit sales for thousands of items sold at different Favorita stores.
 to practice my machine learning skills with an approachable training dataset of dates, store, and item information, promotions,
 and unit sales.

 The SQL queries helped me understand more about the data and also to improve my querying skills.

 The model is located in my Machine learning Excerises directory and the Data Set was obtained from Kaggle:
