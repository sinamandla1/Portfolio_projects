This is a project based on cyber security, it is simple and looks at a data set containing
the number of sectors affected and methods of attack used on each of these companies listed.

What we want to see is the sectors that are mostly targeted and the level of data sensitivity
rating from 1 to 5.

Included in the methods is "oops!" meaning the employee made a careless decision and lost
a device containing company details. And we have cases of inside jobs.
